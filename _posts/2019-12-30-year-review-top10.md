My Top 10 Family Memories from 2019
===

1. September Salt Lake City Trip
  * We successfully didn't rent a car, and stayed at three different hotels
  * Staying at the Marriot below the Mall
  * Waking up at 8am
  * Cleaning room and eating breakfat _(and banning cereal, guacamole, chocolate (especially YL's) and bananas. Mustard still banned from Florida_
  * Swimming from 10am-12pm (breath holding competitions, hot tub and pool transitions)
  * Walking to mall for lunch (and Josephs nap)
  * Dinner's and evenings with Mama!

2. September Beach Trip
  * We told the kids we were going clothes shopping. We actually went to the beach for the day!
  * We built sandcastles, dug in the sand, played in the waves

3. August Arcade Trip
  * Dinner at favorite restaurant, followed by going to the Arcade and playing games!
  * $100 loaded to card, we spent half of it
  * 3 year old twins played the candy machine first (oops), and were into fishing and skee ball and DDR!
  * Mama hit jackpot on skee ball 
  * Twins won princess crowns, Joseph won a ball
  * Twins became absolutely over stimulated

4. Downtown Seattle / Snoqualmie
  * Arrived in downtown right before a parade started, a lot of streets were blocked off. The Hyatt we were staying at was at the parade starting point and all the streets were closed.
  * The police lady yelled at me for ignoring the road closed signs, the hotel employees had to come out and talk to the police
  * Then our transit was too big to park in their garage, so the police let us park illegally all night!
  * We watched the Parade and saw a Santa
  * Snoqualmie Pizza for lunch! Then ice cream! Then Playground!
  * The drive home took 2x longer than it should have because of Joseph

5. First Salt Lake City Trip
  * We were stuck in the parking garage waiting for a car rental for longer than our flight took.
  * Joseph loved the Escalade we rented
  * I took the kids to whole foods for Mochi Balls! Joseph puked it
  * We discovered the mall - tons of food choses, a play area and lots of stores to look around

6. Park City Trip
  * The mountains in the summer were so beautiful
  * The hotel room was a huge suite with a full kitchen
  * The arcade was the biggest let down
  * We ate a pizza feast and bought way too much food
  * A twin threw up in car seat - we had to pull over to clean it up
  * Riding the Gondola to the summit. It was such a hot day

7. Tunes on Tuesday
  * Setting up the booth and talking to people
  * After family showed up suddenly 6 more people were at the booth
  * Getting Ice Cream for everyone

8. Deck Building
  * We got sick of all the rocks always ending up in the house or on the patio
  * We built a huge deck over two weeks (need to finish it next summer with water sealant, railing and furniture!)

9. Mini Olympics
  * All the grandparents coming to watch Gymnastics Mini Olympics!

10. Early Summer Overnight Beach Trip
  * A twin fell in the water while playing in the waves
